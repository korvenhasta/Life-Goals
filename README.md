# Awesome To-Do List

# What

> Current project. There are not many features realized in this project, because I am still working on it. 

This is a to-do list application. You can add a new task and delete it. 

In the future I am going to add a timeline function. You can "zoom out" and see only long-term tasks. When you "zoom in" you see short-term tasks. You can also connect tasks and find out which tasks hepl you to reach your long-term goals.

# Run

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# How
