# Awesome To-Do List

# What

> Current project. There are not many features realized in this project, because I am still working on it. 

This is a to-do list application. You can add a new task and delete it. 

In the future I am going to add a timeline function. You can "zoom out" and see only long-term tasks. When you "zoom in" you see short-term tasks. You can also connect tasks and find out which tasks hepl you to reach your long-term goals.

# Why

- Practice what I've learned about React / Next.js
- I am focusing on making small reusable components in the Atomic Design philosophy: Atoms, Molecules, Organism etc. 
In this way I hope to create my own Design System
- I've always wanted an app like this for myself

# How

In this app I used technologies:
- React
- Next.js
- CSS Modules

Check the code samples to see how I used libraries:
- [React-Hook-Form](https://github.com/korvenhasta/awesome-todo-list/blob/main/components/Form/Form.jsx)
- [Yup validation](https://github.com/korvenhasta/awesome-todo-list/blob/main/validationConfig/yupSchemas.js)

I am keeping track of my progress in a backlog which you can find ![here](https://github.com/users/korvenhasta/projects/1)
